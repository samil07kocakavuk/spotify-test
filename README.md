# 🎧 Spotify Classification Web App

A mock Spotify classification web interface built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**.  
The current version focuses on the frontend experience and UI/UX flow for a future AI-powered music classification system.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project simulates a Spotify-like classification platform where users can explore, upload, or preview song data.  
Although the backend isn’t connected yet, it’s designed to integrate with a future **Python-based AI backend** (currently planned to use **DeepSeek**, but subject to change).
